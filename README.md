# Telecom-Customer-Churn

## Overview

This project aims to predict customer churn in the telecom sector. It uses a dataset containing customer details such as demographic, service-related, and billing information. The goal is to identify patterns and build a predictive model to classify whether a customer will churn (leave the service) or stay.

## Features and Workflow

* Data Import and Preparation:

   * Dataset: The project uses the "WA_Fn-UseC_-Telco-Customer-Churn.csv" dataset.
   * Libraries such as pandas, numpy, matplotlib, and seaborn are employed for data handling and visualization.
   * The dataset is loaded, and its structure is examined to understand customer attributes (e.g., gender, tenure, payment method).
     
* Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):

   * Visualizations help understand customer churn trends, correlations between features, and data distribution.
     Examples: Churn rate by contract type or payment method.
* Data Preprocessing:

    * Handling missing values.
    * Encoding categorical variables (e.g., "gender," "Contract") into numerical formats.
    * Scaling numeric data for model compatibility.
* Modeling:

     * Machine learning algorithms are used to build predictive models.
     * Example models could include Logistic Regression, Random Forest, or Gradient Boosting.
     * The model is trained and tested on the processed dataset.
* Performance Metrics:

     * Accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score are calculated to evaluate model performance.
     * Confusion matrix or ROC curve might also be used.

       
## How It Works

* Input: The model takes customer attributes as input (e.g., tenure, monthly charges, service options).
* Processing: Preprocessed data is fed into the trained model.
* Output: The model predicts whether the customer is likely to churn or not.

## Requirements

  * Software and Libraries:
   
       * Libraries: pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn, scikit-learn
       * Hardware: Moderate CPU and RAM for model training and testing.
       * Dataset: A CSV file containing telecom customer data with attributes and churn labels.
